Advanced OOP Calculator (Zaawansowany Kalkulator OOP)

Project Goal (Cel projektu)
-> The goal of this project was to create a versatile console calculator utilizing Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in principles in Python. 

The calculator is designed with two distinct modes:
-> Basic Mode: Provides fundamental arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulo).
-> Advanced Mode: Extends functionality to include complex mathematical operations (power, square root, logarithm, n-th root).

A core feature of the design is the implementation of state management (memory), allowing users to save and recall results during a session.

Technology Stack (Technologie)
-> Primary Language: Python 3.x
-> Libraries: math (for advanced operations)
-> Architecture: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) with class inheritance (BasicCalculator â†’ AdvancedCalculator)


Getting Started (Jak Odtworzyc Projekt)
1. Requirements - install Python 3.13.7
2. Cloning the Repository: git clone https://github.com/Magdaa1/Calculator.git
3. Running the Calculator  python CalculatorController:.py
4. Usage:
   - Select Mode: Choose 1 (Basic) or 2 (Advance)
   - Navigate Menu: Use number (1-5) for basic operation or letter (P, R, L, N) for advance
   - Memory: Use options M (Memory Functions) to proceed to memory management (M+, MR, MC)
